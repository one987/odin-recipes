    <h3>This cocktail is made for Bartenders.</h3>
    <p><strong>"This was a cocktail</strong> that I created on a Sunday night for an industry person. I basically thought to myself, <em>What if I put all of my favorite things into a glass and just give it to him?</em> And that just happened in an equal-parts sort of scenario. Green Chartreuse is kind of a mixologist's favorite, as well as Fernet. Both of those ingredients have so much intense flavor that people often shy away from them, but bartenders definitely drink them. They each have unique flavor profiles, and with sours, people in the industry really look for a challenge to a palate and intense reactions. It's comforting at first, and then all of a sudden it hits your palate with a bomb of flavor. It's sweet, it's spicy, it's intense, it's minty.</p>
    <p>"I immediately went for equal parts. I've been in the industry for about 14 years, so I have a pretty solid gauge on how spirits work together. Equal parts is also one of the easiest things to remember. Shake it hard and strain it off. Serve it up so the aromatics come through." <em>â€”Ted Kilgore, Taste, St Louis</em></p>
