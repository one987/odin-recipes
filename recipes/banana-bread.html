    <h2>Simply the best! So moist it's practically wet!</h3>

        <p>This banana bread has been the most popular recipe on Odin Recipes for over 10 years. Thousands of people make it every day. Why?

        Because it really is the best banana bread recipe, period. You can mix everything in one bowl, you can vary the amount of sugar or bananas. And the secret to its great flavor? <strong>Melted butter.</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol class="method">
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat the oven and prepare the pan:</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Mash the bananas and add the butter:</h4>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Mix in the remaining ingredients:</h4>
            <p>Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bake the bread:</h4>
            <p>Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cool and serve:</h4>
            <p>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)</p>

                <p>Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
